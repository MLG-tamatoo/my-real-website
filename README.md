What this is about:
This is the tamatoo website, the first I ever made, you might be wondering what this is. Well it is a website that you find codes that
the creator tamatoo will spread on discord. Use the codes to make tamatoo bucks, at the moment you cant do anything with them.

How I made it:
I used python with the main building and data made with flask and flask-sqlalchemy. I also use json for storing the codes I want to use
and some email modules that allow a user to recover their account with an email. The main person that helped, guided, and inpired me is saki
on the Engineerman discord(https://discord.gg/engineerman).
